# How do I install the Code Corps Ember app?

### Requirements

You will need to install the following: 

- [Node.js/npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) we use the LTS branch
- bower: `npm install -g bower`
- ember-cli: `npm install -g ember-cli`

Do you use other versions of node.js? Check out [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

## Clone this repository

You'll want to [clone this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) with `git clone https://github.com/code-corps/code-corps-ember.git`. If you plan on contributing, you'll want to fork it too!

The directory structure will look like the following:

```shell
code-corps-ember/    # → Root folder for this project

package.json         # → Npm configuration and dependency list
...
```

## Install your dependencies

> Note: We bind to ports 4200 for Ember and 49152 for livereloading. Make sure you aren't running anything else on these ports.

Go to the `code-corps-ember` directory and run:

```shell
npm install
bower install
```

Both commands will install the necessary dependencies and will display output regarding those.

### Troubleshooting

If you receive any errors like the following during `npm install`:

```shell
npm ERR! Command failed: git -c core.longpaths=true fetch -a origin
npm ERR! Permission denied (publickey).
npm ERR! fatal: Could not read from remote repository.
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Please make sure you have the correct access rights
npm ERR! and the repository exists.
```

you will need to [associate your ssh key with github](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-an-ssh-key/)

## Verify it worked
Run `ember server`

Point your browser (or make a direct request) to `http://localhost:4200`. You should see the code corps website.

### Next steps

Now that you're set up, you should [read more about how to develop with the API](USAGE.md).
